        <h2 class="heading">Christ The Redeemer</h2>
        Christ the Redeemer is a monumental statue located in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It is the symbol of the city and, beyond that, of the whole Brazil. It is also a symbol of Christianity among the most important of the World. Christ the Redeemer is also an important tourist destination, with 600,000 visitors a year.

        <p>
        
            It was first imagined in 1850 by a Catholic priest, but this project was born in 1920, when a petition of support was initiated for the construction of a Christian statue. Once the style was chosen, construction began in 1922, and took nine years to be completed. Today, Christ the Redeemer is one of the seven new wonders of the world, a title recently given to 7 world monuments to reflect the list of 7 ancient wonders. It is also the most famous monument in Brazil, and its symbole, such as the Statue of Liberty is for the United States, the Eiffel Tower for France, or the Taj Mahal for India.

Today the Christ of Rio, or the Corcovado as it is called more frequently, is a monument very visited, it is among the most visited monuments of Brazil. 
        </p>
        <h2><center>History of Christ the Redeemer</center></h2>
        <h3>The Site of the Corcovado</h3>
        <p>
            It is in the XVIth century that begins the history of the redeeming Christ of Rio. At that time the Portuguese, who dominated the Brazilian territory, gave the name of "pinnacle of temptation" to a strange mountain located near the Atlantic coast in Rio de Janeiro. This name is a reference found in the Bible. A century later this mountain will be renamed Corcovado, a name deriving from the word "Bosse" which was given to him by its general form similar to the back of a hunchback.

Surrounded by a dense forest and with steep relief, this mountain was not accessible. It was not until 1824 that a path was opened to reach its summit, which was to be widened rapidly on the way.
        </p>
        <h3>The First Project, Abandoned!?</h3>
        <p>
            the idea of the construction of a monument religion at its summit dates much later, in 1859. That year there arrived on the spot Father Pedro Maria Boss, a lazarist. He was overwhelmed by the beauty of the site and decided to meet the queen of Brazil Isabella to ask for the necessary funds for the construction of this monument. The meeting actually took place that year, but it was not followed up. The project was abandoned and the idea lost.
            <br>
            
But the Corcovado, now accessible, attracted people. A railroad was decided in the 1880s, built in the wake and inaugurated on October 9, 1884. Starting from Cosme Velho station, the line measured (and still measures, by the way) 3824m and climbs to the top of the Corcovado in a series of laces and twenty minutes. It was Emperor Peter II of Brazil himself who inaugurated it. Pierre II of Brazil will be seen a few years later at the inauguration of the Eiffel Tower.

This railway was not only a technical challenge, it was also a symbolic challenge insofar as the Corcovado was nothing but a peak at the time, the railway had no purpose of tourism. Developing tourism at the end of the nineteenth century was truly an innovative idea, since the economic strength of a country was at that time rather oriented towards heavy industry or agriculture.

        <h3>
            Launching of the Project
        </h3>
        <p>
            A call for competition is launched and in 1923 the winner is informed that he was chosen in September of this year. It is the project of the Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, the latter being a personality of the time. This project was that of a gigantic statue of Christ bearing a cross which he clasped against his body with the help of his hand, his other hand holding a celestial globe. He made drawings and launched the project of construction, estimating cost, time, and especially method of construction. Unfortunately, the project never really started, both because of the funding that was struggling to arrive and the insoluble technical constraints. The first stone was laid down, but on principle.


        </p>
        <h3>Project Redesign</h3>
        <p>
            The work began on April 4, 1922, with the laying of the first stone, but it was only a symbolic launch, since the next two years were devoted to the improvement of the statue, the choice of structure and materials. Thus it was not until 1926 that the work began, but they did not go very quickly. Wooden models were built, of various sizes, to be able to work.

In 1928 there was an important event, the revision of part of the project. Indeed, some people found the shape of the statue unsuitable, even laughing at the cross and above all the celestial globe which made them nickname the work "Christ with the balloon" (This, a hundred years later and in the country of football, would not have lacked salt). Still, he had to reconsider his plan.

He then began to study the Corcovado and especially the point of view from the city, from which point a telecommunications antenna erected by Westinghouse stood. He therefore chooses a new form, proposed by the artist Carlos Oswald: Christ himself would be the cross, his outstretched arms signifying the redemption of mankind at the crucifixion. But the new design has introduced new challenges. Da Silva Costa had already concluded that the structure would need to be enormous to be visible from the city center (4 km, anyway) It should also have been particularly strong to support the massive arms. Da Silva Costa therefore decided that reinforced concrete, "the material of the future" as he foresaw, would be the material to use for his statue.

The problem was that this new material required special knowledge. So they went to Europe where he knew he could find them. It is there that he meets Antoine Bourdelle, who had worked with Rodin and who was one of those approached to make a model a 4m high ladder from Oswald's drawings. But it did not end with him, and finally it was the French sculptor Paul Landowski, of Polish origin, who was chosen as responsible for the construction of the monument. He asked Gheorghe Leonida, a Romanian sculptor, to take care of the face of Christ, a delicate operation, but otherwise the spots were simple: Silva Costa was the designer of the statue, Carlos Oswald the draftsman, Paul Landowski the sculptor, aided by Gheorghe Leonida. But there was still a problem to be solved: We still did not know how to make a concrete architecture so imposing, so there was a link in the chain.

Silva Costa asked Albert Caquot, a French engineer, to take on the role of the designer of internal architecture. It is he who will make the concrete part, as well as all the calculations that go with it.
        </p>
        <h3>The Construction</h3>
        <p>
            a team of specialists was formed, we could move forward. First of all, Paul Landowski modified the drawings of Oswald. He purified the head and hands in a modern style for the time, very clean. Then he made the clay head, in real size, then a hand. This work, made in Paris, was sent by boat to Rio. Received on site the job consisted of reproducing concrete models of clay, which took some time. At the same time the summit of the Corcovado welcomed the base of the statue and a steel frame was already in place. But the choice of coating was still not final.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Funding and Cost
        </h3>
        <p>
            Funding was difficult to find, and was provided by a charitable collection made in the name of the Church to the parishioners (essentially), but this fund-raising struggled to progress. The Church had to play an important role in raising awareness among Catholics so that the money raised could correspond to the total amount of the project. It should be noted that the campaign was national, not international.
            <br>
            They had to solicit the contributors to make a donation of more than ten thousand reis. But by the end of the week only half of the money had been collected, so it was necessary to make a new campaign.

The cost of construction was $ 250,000, but that is an approximation, we do not have the details of all the costs, whether they are purchases of materials or service, such as studies on the general shape, or even labor, necessarily quite consistent. Some people have estimated the correspondence of this cost if Christ redeemer had been built these days: It is $ 3.2 million, which is quite low for a monument of this size.


        </p>
        <h3>
            Controversy
        </h3>
        <p>
            If the fact of offering a religious statue on the Corcovado, so visible from Rio, did not really have a negative impact on the local population, the fact that it was a Catholic installation caused some the religious communities of the region. From the initiation of the project in 1923, the first protests were made, in particular Protestant organizations (without any pun intended)

But this sense of forced evangelization which provoked the statue of Christ the Redeemer quickly disappeared in the face of the beauty of the work and the universal significance of the message it conveys.
