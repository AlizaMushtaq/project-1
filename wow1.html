        <h2 class="heading">The Colosseum</h2>
        <p>The Colosseum is the name of a Roman amphitheater dating back to antiquity, built under the reigns of the emperors Vespasian and Titus, then modified by Domitian.
           <br> It is sometimes called the Flavian amphitheater, its current name is a derivative of the adjective 'colossal', which is one of these characteristics.

        <h2>History of The Colosseum</h2>
        <p>
            The Colosseum is the main amphitheater of the Roman world, it is the largest, and the most symbolic too. Built from 70 AD (possibly 72), it was inaugurated only 10 years later. Very soon, heavy improvements were made, but once finished it was not changed any further. On the other hand, it undergoes throughout its history many restorations or repair works because very regularly it was damaged by fires or earthquakes.

Finally, very few degradations were made by the hand of the man, most of the damage came from natural disasters.
It is a real feat to find the Colosseum in its current state of preservation when one sees its painful past. Destroyed completely during antiquity it was rebuilt identically at least once, but every 20 years a natural disaster seriously damaged it, and that until the fourteenth century, the time of the great earthquakes that shook the l 'Europe.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Inaugration
        </h3>
        <p>
            If the emperor Vespasian is at the origin of the construction of the Colosseum of Rome, it is his son Titus who will inaugurate it in 80 AD, Vespasian having died meanwhile, in 79. But the Colosseum was not completed at the time of its inauguration, but it was in a complete state corresponding - it seems - to the initial planned plans.

            The inauguration ceremony was grand, and the festivities lasted a hundred days, which is a record in the matter. During these hundred days the monument hosted various shows, without stopping. Titus did not reign long, he died in 81 and it was his brother Domitian who ascended the throne.
            
            
        </p>
<h3>
    The First Repair
</h3>
<p>
    Almost as soon as it was built, the Colosseum was repaired. Indeed, although it is essentially stone many elements of its architecture were wood and metal, so subject to fire. But fires are the main disasters that took place in the city during antiquity. For a few hundred years, until about the fifth century, the Colosseum was the subject of several fires but also of earthquakes, provoking regularly either it is repaired or rebuilt. When we talk about rebuilding the Colosseum, we talk about redoing a part of the superstructure, recosntruire the hypogeum (the halls under the arena) and the arena itself, so it was real complex work that could last several dozens of years. This is what happened when it was struck by lightning in 217. It was reopened in 222 but the work was completed in 240 only.
</p>
<h3>Superior Antiquity</h3>
<p>
    The Colosseum was used until the 6th century as a theater. He was particularly busy, with a show every 2/3 days or so, so the pace was quite high.

Under Philippus took place the celebrations of the millennium of Rome, in 248, they were particularly impressive. A large number of exotic animals brought to the arena by his predecessor Gordien were killed in the war against the Persians.

During the first centuries the Colosseum was also used to kill Christians, so there is evidence of the deaths of Saints Abdon and Sennen who were murdered there. If the persecution of Christians is a historical fact in ancient Rome, it is a period of history that is not that long thanks to the rapid expansion of the Christian religion in the Roman Empire. From the beginning of the fourth century this religion manages to influence the political decisions of the emperor. Thus the gladiatorial combats, always very popular with the population, were modified to transform them into a spectacle rather than a killing. At that time gladiators could more easily be protected, including by the emperor himself.

At the beginning of the fifth century the emperors Theodosius and Gratian, empires of the West and the East, forbade paganism and the pagan rites that ensue from it. Gladiator fights are forbidden, the last will take place in 404. From then on the Colosseum is no longer used as it was until now, it will remain so but it is no longer the center of the leisure activity of the inhabitants but becomes an empty shell in the heart of Rome.

During the sack of Rome by the Visigoths, between 408 and 410, the surroundings of the Colosseum will be used as cemeteries, since it was impossible to go outside the city to bury the dead. This vocation will continue until the 6th century, a period during which the Colosseum ceases to be used and actually becomes a cemetery.

In parallel during the fifth century the Mediterranean region suffered many earthquakes which damaged the building at regular intervals. However, it was repaired each time as evidenced by the various engraved stones announcing the end of the work.
